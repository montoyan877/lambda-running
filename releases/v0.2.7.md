# Version 0.2.7

## Fixes

- **Improved TypeScript hot reloading**: Implemented a more robust solution for TypeScript hot reloading. Now works correctly with both external dependencies and imported modules, and is compatible with both npm installations and npm link.

- Enhanced cache clearing system to ensure all modified files are properly reloaded, including modules in node_modules that belong to the current project.

- Added support for clearing the ts-node compilation cache, fixing recompilation issues in dependent TypeScript files.
