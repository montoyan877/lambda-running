# Version 0.1.1

## Improvements

- Added automatic exclusion of `node_modules` directory during scanning to improve performance
- Added support for `.lambdarunignore` file to customize which directories and files are ignored during scanning
- Added automatic loading of environment variables from `.env` files in the project root
- Modified scanner to specifically detect functions named `handler` to align with AWS Lambda conventions
- Enhanced TypeScript support to use the project's own `tsconfig.json` configuration
- Added support for TypeScript path aliases (like `@/*`) using tsconfig-paths
- Added command-line options to control ignore behavior:
  - `--include-node-modules`: Include node_modules in scan (not recommended)
  - `--no-ignore-file`: Ignore the .lambdarunignore file
  - `--no-env`: Disable automatic loading of environment variables
- Added programmatic API options to control scanning behavior and environment loading

## Documentation

- Added detailed documentation for `.lambdarunignore` feature
- Added documentation for environment variable loading
- Added documentation for TypeScript path alias support
- Updated README with information about the new features and improved TypeScript support
- Improved comments and function documentation
- Updated examples to use the `handler` function name

## Notes

This release focuses on performance improvements when scanning for Lambda handlers by excluding unnecessary directories, adds the ability to automatically load environment variables from `.env` files, aligns the behavior more closely with AWS Lambda conventions by focusing on functions named `handler`, and provides better integration with TypeScript projects by using their existing configuration, including support for path aliases.
